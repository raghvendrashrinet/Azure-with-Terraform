# 📦 Terraform Blocks – Overview

In **Terraform**, a **block** is the fundamental unit of configuration. All Terraform configuration files (`.tf`) are made up of blocks that define **what Terraform should do** and **how** it should interact with external systems.

---

## 🧱 What is a Block?

A **block** in Terraform:
- Begins with a **block type** (like `resource`, `provider`, `variable`, etc.)
- Can include one or more **labels**
- Contains **arguments** (key-value pairs)
- May also contain **nested blocks**

### 🔹 Syntax of a Block

```hcl
block_type "label1" "label2" {
  argument_name = argument_value

  nested_block {
    ...
  }
}
```

> Example:
```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "my-rg"
  location = "East US"
}
```

## 🗂️ Common Types of Blocks in Terraform

| Block Type         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `terraform`        | Project-level settings like required providers and backend config. |
| `provider`         | Defines how Terraform connects to external APIs (e.g., Azure, AWS). |
| `resource`         | Describes infrastructure to be created (e.g., VMs, Storage Accounts). |
| `variable`         | Declares input parameters to make the config dynamic. |
| `output`           | Defines values to be displayed after deployment (e.g., IP addresses). |
| `module`           | Reuses and organizes code by referencing external or local modules. |
| `locals`           | Declares local values (constants or expressions). |
| `data`             | Reads existing resources without creating them (read-only access). |

## 🔍 Example of Each Block

### 1. `terraform` block

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "4.37.0"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 2. `provider` block

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

---

### 3. `resource` block

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "main" {
  name     = "demo-rg"
  location = "East US"
}
```

---

### 4. `variable` block

```hcl
variable "location" {
  type    = string
  default = "East US"
}
```

---

### 5. `output` block

```hcl
output "rg_name" {
  value = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
}
```

---

### 6. `locals` block

```hcl
locals {
  rg_name = "my-local-rg"
}
```

---

### 7. `data` block

```hcl
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}
```

---

### 8. `module` block

```hcl
module "network" {
  source    = "./modules/network"
  vnet_name = "demo-vnet"
}
```

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Terraform configurations are composed of **blocks**.
- Each **block type** has a specific purpose (defining infra, logic, settings).
- Mastering block structure and usage is essential for writing scalable, reusable infrastructure code.
